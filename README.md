# Room LED Driver
Is a 2 channel dimming driver with a (custom) gamma correction based on a Arduino Uno.
In my chase it`s dimming a warm and a cold white channel.
Have look in the documentation for information's of the custom gamma correction.
If you need more, add more. You will be limited by your MCU.
